# imhof

Draw maps using OpenStreetMaps data and HGT data.

This project was realized for the course "Practice of Object Oriented Programming" taught at EPFL. As such, it was meant as a learning experience.

Many interesting topics were covered by the project, including:

 - Immutability and its perks (many classes are immutable)
 - Functions as first class citizens in Java 8 (the `ch.epfl.imhof.painting.Painter.java` interface)
 - Files and streams (`ch.epfl.imhof.dem.HGTDigitalElevationModel.java`)
 - Basic graphics in Java

and many more smaller aspects of working on an object oriented project.

An exhaustive [javadoc](javadoc/index.html) is available in French as it was the language used to teach the course.
